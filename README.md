# KnowCountries

KnowCountries displays all the countries in the home page. User can click on any of the country to see more detailed information about the country. Also, users can search for any particular country by simply providing the name on the search input field.

## How to install

1. Clone the project `git clone https://github.com/dikxak/know-countries`.

2. Install all the dependencies `npm install` or `npm i`.

3. Run the project `npm start`.

After these steps, the localhost server on port 3000 will start - [localhost](http://localhost:3000).

## How to use

After [localhost](http://localhost:3000) is started by the React development server, the home page should look like below:

Now, you can search for the country using input field. I have searched for USA:
![USA in search input field](/src/img_markdown/search_country.PNG)

Also, you can view the details of certain country by clicking on it. I have clicked on Brazil:

The use can also toggle between dark and light mode by using the toggle button provided on the navbar.
